Main methods:

● For board_start_mode = 1, the board should be arranged randomly as follows. Each cell is
`alive’ with probability ½ (and `dead’ with the complement probability, that is, ½ as well). you
can use the np.random module.

● For board_start_mode = 2, the board should be arranged randomly as follows. Each cell is
`alive’ with probability 0.8 (and `dead’ with the complement probability, that is, 0.2). you can
use the np.random module.

● For board_start_mode = 3, the board should be arranged randomly as follows. Each cell is
`alive’ with probability 0.2 (and `dead’ with the complement probability, that is, 0.8). you can
use the np.random module.

● For board_start_mode = 4, the board should start empty with a Gosper Glider Gun in top left
cell at (10, 10).
